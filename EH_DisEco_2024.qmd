Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

```

The epidemiological triad describes the relationship between the three factors that interact when disease occurs. This is a very simplistic view of the interactions between the host, pathogen, and environment. In reality, there are often more than one and different types of hosts, evolving pathogens, and changing environments. This makes epidemiology much more complex than the traditional triangle.

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired confidence level is 95%.

-   **59 deer**

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

-   **+299 individuals**

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

-   **+229 individuals (higher prevalence in population, so less individuals must be tested in order to detect)**

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is **1%**.

4\) An outbreak of 'Lame disease' has been reported in wild turkey populations of Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers, and Russell counties).

a\) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county. Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne's method.

-   **Prevalence Lee County- 0.200 (0.143, 0.273)**

-   **Prevalence Chambers County- 0.267 (0.131, 0.449)**

-   **Prevalence Russell County- 0.031 (0.009, 0.087)**

b\) Compare prevalence using Fisher's exact test.

-   **Two-sided confidence interval \<0.0001.**

-   **The result is significant.**

5\) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.\
She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:\
Day 1: 3 fish infected\
Day 2: 4 fish infected\
Day 3: 7 fish infected\
Day 4: 11 fish infected\
Day 5: 20 fish infected

\
Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish\
in the pond (including previously infected fish).

\
a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.

-   **Incidence day 1= 3/60=0.05 cases per fish-day**

-   **Incidence day 2= 4/57=0.07 cases per fish-day**

-   **Incidence day 5= 20/35=0.57 cases per fish-day**

\
b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?

-   **Prevalence day 3= 7/60=0.12= 12%**

-   **Prevalence day 5= 20/60=0.33=33%**

\
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

-   **Day 1**

-   **3/60=0.05**

Modeling Memo

Modeling is a valuable asset to understanding the dynamics of a disease. Wildlife diseases, in particular, can be difficult to manage due to the complexity of the ecosystems the disease is affecting. For example, wildlife diseases often have numerous host species, vectors, and dead-end hosts, all of which can play a role in the spread of a disease. It is often questioned whether or not it is even necessary to monitor and control the spread of disease in wildlife–the survival of the fittest idea. While this concept is defensible to some extent, wildlife disease and disease of captive animals and humans interact more often than one might think. Wildlife diseases are often zoonoses, meaning they can be transmitted from animal to human. Even if the concern isn’t human health, wildlife disease can travel into captive animal populations, decimating agricultural and hunting populations. Further, mass mortality from wildlife disease of a specific species can upset the delicate balance of an ecosystem, creating a chain reaction that can severely damage other species lives as well.

Part of some wildlife biologists’ and managers’ issue with disease modeling is that it isn’t necessarily a true representation of a population; however, when data is collected on a population, that cannot be said to be a true representation of a population either. It is impossible to collect all the data on every single animal in a population in order to accurately represent them in a model. This is where disease modeling comes into play. Disease modeling uses certain assumptions and existing data (however sparse) to play out different scenarios based on changing factors. Disease modeling doesn’t need true representative data; it makes an inference based on the data provided. This is why models aren’t said to be predictors, only a tool to lead to better outcomes and more critical thinking. In the context of wildlife disease, using data from previous years, a model can estimate the outcomes for a population. This can show where potential interventions could be applied, or what would happen if nothing was done. Disease modeling is good for showing scenarios where decisions must be made about whether or not to intervene in a wildlife disease outbreak. 

Some of the limitations of disease models can be attributed to data uncertainty. While a disease model is not necessarily an accurate representation of data, it can be used to manipulate different factors to show the effects of interventions. Further, how can we be certain that data collected by other means is truly an accurate representation? The best method for estimating and inferring outcomes is to combine reliable sourced data with manufactured data from a disease model. This combination will give a more accurate picture of what will happen when certain variables are manipulated. The other issue that some find with disease modeling is that it lacks the ecological complexity of a system. This is true but for a reason. If a model was meant to represent an entire ecosystem, it would be quite vague in its data inferences. This is why disease models are only meant to represent a specific question. This is also why disease modeling should be used in conjunction with other methods to make decisions. It is true that ecological complexity gets in the way of truly estimating the effects of wildlife disease, so we must use a combination of methods to try to represent that ecological complexity.

The fecal flotation lab from last week demonstrated how we can perform simple experiments to track the prevalence of parasites in a population. The lab was fairly simple, although different from how I perform fecal floats at work. We started by watching the grad students perform the process and taking notes, then we were able to do the process ourselves. We started by measuring 2 grams of feces into a paper cup and adding 13 mL of water. This was mixed, then strained into another cup, then transfered to a 5 mL tube. We then added 1 mL of a sugar solution to the 5 mL tube. The next step was to vortex the sample so that the ova didn't settle to the bottom, and transfer 1 mL of the sample quickly into the 5 mL tube. This was done twice. Then, we mixed the sugar solution with the sample by drawing the solution into the pipette and back into the tube several times. This solution was then placed into a counter slide and left to rest for 5 minutes. Then, we were able to look at the slides under a microscope and count each ova that we saw. Each ova was meant to represent 50 ova per gram of sample. Unfortunately, in our sample, we didn't see any ova. The grad students explained that the samples we were using came from animals that were dewormed, and they don't usually see a lot of ova. The grad student who runs the lab is writing on the effect of dewormer on cattle populations and if it is truly effective in the current way that deworming is done (every animal gets dewormed regularly even if they do not show signs of infection).
