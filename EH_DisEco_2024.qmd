Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

```

The epidemiological triad describes the relationship between the three factors that interact when disease occurs. This is a very simplistic view of the interactions between the host, pathogen, and environment. In reality, there are often more than one and different types of hosts, evolving pathogens, and changing environments. This makes epidemiology much more complex than the traditional triangle.

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired confidence level is 95%.

-   **59 deer**

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

-   **+299 individuals**

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

-   **+229 individuals (higher prevalence in population, so less individuals must be tested in order to detect)**

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is **1%**.

4\) An outbreak of 'Lame disease' has been reported in wild turkey populations of Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers, and Russell counties).

a\) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county. Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne's method.

-   **Prevalence Lee County- 0.200 (0.143, 0.273)**

-   **Prevalence Chambers County- 0.267 (0.131, 0.449)**

-   **Prevalence Russell County- 0.031 (0.009, 0.087)**

b\) Compare prevalence using Fisher's exact test.

-   **Two-sided confidence interval \<0.0001.**

-   **The result is significant.**

5\) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.\
She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:\
Day 1: 3 fish infected\
Day 2: 4 fish infected\
Day 3: 7 fish infected\
Day 4: 11 fish infected\
Day 5: 20 fish infected

\
Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish\
in the pond (including previously infected fish).

\
a) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.

-   **Incidence day 1= 3/60=0.05 cases per fish-day**

-   **Incidence day 2= 4/57=0.07 cases per fish-day**

-   **Incidence day 5= 20/35=0.57 cases per fish-day**

\
b) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?

-   **Prevalence day 3= 7/60=0.12= 12%**

-   **Prevalence day 5= 20/60=0.33=33%**

\
c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

-   **Day 1**

-   **3/60=0.05**
