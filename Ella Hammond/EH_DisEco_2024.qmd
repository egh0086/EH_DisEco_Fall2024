Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")

This is a painting located at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts. My family visited Boston this summer and we made a day trip to Salem. One of the unexpected adventures we went on was the Peabody Essex Museum, which had an exhibit all about bats, including live Egyptian Fruit Bats.
